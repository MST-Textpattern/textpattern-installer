h1. Textpattern Plugin Installer for Composer

p. ...or what may hopefully end up being an installer for Composer. Still work in progress.

h2. Basics

p. This installer works by scanning composer.json's sibling and parent directories for a Textpattern installation. If found, it injects Textpattern to the Composer process. It then collects and parses the plugin package and installs it to the Textpattern installation's database, invoking plugin-lifecycle updaters and installers as needed.

h2. Requirements

p. Configured and functional, existing Textpattern installation.
